### ***Description***
Tiny houses have seen ever-increasing interest going on five years in a row. Unfortunately, as the demand and usage grow, the legality and zoning for tiny house parking is far slower to improve. Some cities allow them as "accessory dwelling units" in conjunction with some nearby house-proper on residentially-zoned property, but that is far from the norm. To date, finding a place to park your tiny home is *still* the number one challenge and downside for tiny-dwellers everywhere.

This application aims to provide a way to connect tiny house owners with permanent-homeowners or property owners with extra space they're willing to rent out. Taking a leaf out of AirBnB's book-- where temporary renting/sharing of internal home space is allowed without certified landlordship or property manager-hood-- **Wheel Estate** rolls with the current legal system to enable temporary renting/sharing of *external* home space (property) without new zoning or certifications required. As the method of booking is temporary-- *not* indefinite/fulltime-- and on private property as permitted by the owner of the property, **Wheel Estate** facilitates tiny house parking *within* existing laws.
