### ***Description***
##### The definitive tiny house parking app!
Tiny living has seen ever-increasing growth for years. Unfortunately, finding a place to legally park your tiny home is *still* the number one challenge and downside for tiny-dwellers everywhere.

This application aims to provide a way to connect tiny-homeowners with property owners with extra space they're willing to rent out. Taking a leaf out of AirBnB's book of hosting internal home space, **Wheel Estate** seeks to enable temporary rental/sharing of *external* home space (property).

##### *General Assembly SEI Unit 2 project.*

* JavaScript w/ Node.js, React.js, React Router
